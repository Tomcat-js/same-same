# Same Same <hr /> 

## A Matching Game.  [See Here](https://same-same-the-game.herokuapp.com/)

### Description <hr /> 
“Same Same” is a simple and fun matching game. The game was created to help children with ASD learn to categorise non-identical images. Matching skills are an important first step toward language development.  

### Features and Technologies <hr /> 
* HTML
* CSS
* Node.js
* Javascript
* Axios
* Giphy API
* Responsive design


### Key Challenges <hr /> 
This project was inspired by my son who has autism. As part of his Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy he has to identify a large variety of non-identical images. The ability to identify, generalise and categorise images is an essential part of language development. I decided to use this project as an opportunity to make something with Node.js. In retrospect it may not have been the best choice for this type of application. One key issue is that in order top make an axios call to the giphy API the user essentially has to refresh the page each turn. I was intending to add background music but decided against it due to this.  Passing data from the server to the front end was possible thanks to embedded JavaScript templating but I’m not sure it was the most elegant solution. Perhaps this project would have been better created using an entirely front end technology such as React. Also in the end I felt that the Giphy stickers were possibly too difficult for a child with autism to match and they are also occasionally inappropriate for a younger audience.  However, I learnt a lot from this project and enjoyed the process of creating the game.
